# Configuration File for Appx-DB Modification Script                                   #
# ==================================================                                   #
# The Appx-Database ("StateRepository-Machine.srd") of Windows 10 contains Information #
# about installed Appx-Packages and controls their Distribution to the Users.  Some of #
# the preinstalled System-Apps like "MicrosoftStore" or the "Content Delivery Manager" #
# being responsible for lot of Ads, Telemetry and self-installing Store-Apps cannot be #
# uninstalled via Modern Settings Dialog or PowerShell. This is because these Packages #
# are protected from Uninstallation by a special Flag ("IsInbox") within the "Package" #
# Table of the Appx-Database. This Table lists all installed Appx-Packages. The Column #
# named "IsInbox" defines the Protection State for each Package by containing either a #
# Value of 1 which means the Package is a "Part Of The Box" and therefore it cannot be #
# uninstalled or a Value of 0 meaning that the Appx-Package can be uninstalled for all #
# Users.
# By Modifying the IsInbox-Value of an Appx-Package to 0 the Protection of the Package #
# will be diabled and it can be uninstalled by Settings Dialog or PowerShell.          #
# This File defines how the Protection State of the listed Packages is modified by the #
# Script. It's sufficient to only specify a Part of the Package Name. Thereby the File #
# will stay compatible among further Version Builds of Windows 10.                     #
