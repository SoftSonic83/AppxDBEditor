<h2>Version: 1.2 (Initial Import)</h2>

<h4><ins>PURPOSE:</ins></h4>

<p>
	This Script automates all the necessary Steps, needed to change the
	Protection State of preinstalled System Apps in Windows 10, so that they
	can be removed afterwards by either PowerShell or Modern Settings Dialog.
</p>

<h4><ins>FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:</ins></h4>

<p>
	The Script modifies the Appx-Database of Windows 10 to change the Protection
	States of preinstalled System-Apps so that they can be uninstalled. The Appx-
	Database ("StateRepository-Machine.srd") of Windows 10 contains Information
	about all installed Appx-Packages and controls their Distribution to the Users.
	Some of those preinstalled System-Apps like the Store ("MicrosoftStore") or the
	"Content Delivery Manager" being responsible for lots of Ads, Telemetry-Data and
	self-installing Apps, cannot be uninstalled via Modern Settings Dialog or
	PowerShell. This is because all these Packages are protected from Uninstallation
	by a special Flag ("IsInbox") within the "Package" Table of the Appx-DB. This
	SQLite-Table lists all installed Appx-Packages. The Column named "IsInbox"
	defines the Protection State for each Package by containing either a Value of 1
	which means that the Package is a "Part Of The Box" and therefore it cannot be
	uninstalled or a Value of 0 indicating that the Appx-Package can be uninstalled
	for all Users.
</p>

<p>
	By Modifying the "IsInbox"-Value of an Appx-Package to 0 the Protection of the
	Package will be disabled and can be therefore uninstalled by Settings Dialog or
	PowerShell. A Config File defines how the Protection State of the listed Packages
	is modified by the Script. It's sufficient to only specify a Part of the Package
	Name. Thereby the File will stay compatible among further Version Builds of Windows
	10.
</p>

<p>
	Until now it was easily possible to manually edit the IsInbox Values by	Using a
	graphical Editor like SQLite Database Browser. Since the newest	Build of Windows
	10 (1809), you will get an Error Message saying "no such function: workid", when
	using such Editors. This is because the StateRepository Database now contains
	Trigger Functions, which will get triggered to execute if specific Values are
	modified within the "Package" Table. These Functions cannot execute when the
	Database is opened in the Editor and so the above Error is thrown. To bypass this
	Problem all Triggers have to be safed and temporarily removed from the Database
	first before Editing any IsInbox Values. After applying the SQL-Statements to
	Update the IsInbox Values all Triggers are beeing recreated by this Script.
</p>

<h4><ins>NOTICE:</ins></h4>

<p>
	By Removing any preinstalled and protected System-Apps you may no longer get any
	Feature-Updates	for your Windows 10 Installation in the Future.
</p>

<h4><ins>SCRIPT FEATURES:</ins></h4>

<p>
        This Menu- and Dialog-Driven Batch-Script operates based on a Configuration File
        in which you can specify the Names of the Packages and their respective Protection
        States that have to be set by the Script. The Script provides the following features:

<h4><ins>ADDENDUM:</ins></h4>

<p>
	By now the Script has reached Final Version 1.2 and has been successfully tested
	on Version 1809 and 1803 of Windows. Since Microsoft continually changes Names of
	the Packages and whether they are stored as Appx-Package in the Appx-Database or
	as Classic Desktop Package within the Component Based Store (CBS), the Name(s) and
	Presence of certain Packages may vary among different Windows Builds.

	In the Beginning this Script was just made for personal Usage. But then I found this
	Post <ins><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/

	rel="nofollow">LTSC 2019 SYSPRP Failed to remove apps for the current user: 0x80073cf2</a></ins>
	where other People also have discussed the Issue of Removing protected System Apps.
	So I decided to share it with the Community. If you have any Comments or Suggestions,
	please let me know.
